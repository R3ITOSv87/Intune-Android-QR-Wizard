## Overview

The **WiFi QR-Code Wizard** empowers IT admins and power users to generate Android Enterprise enrollment QR codes **with WiFi configuration included** â€“ even when Intuneâ€™s built-in options are limited.  
Just upload the Intune enrollment JSON, add your WiFi details (SSID, WPA/WPA2/WPA3, etc.), and download a ready-to-use QR code for zero-touch Android setup.

## Why This Project?

Microsoft Intune enables QR-based Android enrollment, but often these QR codes **donâ€™t support pre-configured WiFi access**.  
This can disrupt fully automated device provisioning and cause friction for end-users during initial setup.

**The WiFi QR-Code Wizard solves this:**

- Merge WiFi settings into any exported Intune enrollment QR JSON.
- Generate a standards-compliant QR code with all credentials.
- No cloud, no upload â€“ everything runs 100% locally in your browser.

  All data stays on your device â€“ nothing is uploaded or stored externally.

   - Enter your WiFi SSID, password, security type (WPA/WPA2/WPA3, WEP, Open), and specify if the SSID is hidden.
   - Optionally, review or adjust the raw JSON.

4. **Generate & Deploy**
